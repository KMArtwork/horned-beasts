# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Lab 02 - Time Estimates

### Feature Task 01: Display Images

Estimate of time needed to complete: 45m

Start time: 3:16PM

Finish time: 3:30PM

Actual time needed to complete: 15m

### Feature Task 02: Allow Users to Favorite Individual Beasts

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 3:30PM

Finish time: 3:50PM

Actual time needed to complete: 20m

*Getting the minimum functionality to handle clicks and display that on screen took about 10m but I also tweaked some CSS which probably took about another 10minutes; 

### Feature Task 03: Bootstrap

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 3:52PM

Finish time: 5:20PM

Actual time needed to complete: 88m / 71m if not including snack time

*From 3:52 - 4:11 I reviewed the Bootstrap documentation. From 4:11 - 4:28 I took a quick snack break.

### Stretch Goal: Add Interaction

Estimate of time needed to complete: 60m

Start time: 5:25PM

Finish time: 5:39PM

Actual time needed to complete: 14m

*Spent 5:39 - 5:52 trying to figure out how to pass a function as a prop? Right now, I have a function in my Header.js file that changes the colors of certain elements when the header element is clicked. Is it possible to nest that function in App.js and then pass it as a prop to my Header, Main, and Footer .js files so that they can all inherit that function behavior as an `onClick`? As opposed to me just copy/pasting the function in each .js file and then giving them `onClick` event handlers?

## Lab 03 - Time Estimates

### Feature Task 01 - Display a Modal

Estimate of time needed to complete: 30 - 45m

Start time: 2:57PM

Finish time: 5:47PM

Actual time needed to complete: 2HR 50M

### Feature Task 01 - Display a Model (retry)

Start time: ~10:00-10:15PM

Finish time: ~11:40PM
